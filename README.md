# Expense_and_budget_app
I created this program so that a user can reach their financial goals, by putting in their expenses, incomes, and budgets.
The user can:
- view, add, update and delete all and any expenses they make,
- View, add, update and delete all and any income they gain,
- View, update, delete and set a budget on any category,
- View, update, delete, set financial goals and view their progress towards said financial goal depending on their total income and expenses.
This data is then stored and updated on a database using SQL.
